Hey there! Just some important notes here:

-  Go to this link to play the game!: https://ecspickard.github.io    (You may have to reload once)

-  If you want to download these files and run it yourself, **you must run it on a live server!** To connect with the Google Map API, the files have to be able to connect to the internet,
   so a live server is required. The easiest way to do this is using the Live Server extension in VSCode.

- To run the file locally, run *index.html* on the live server. Everything else should take care of itself!

- That's it for now! Enjoy the game! :)
